# ðŸ¦™ LlamB Browser Extension

A Chrome extension that provides an AI chat sidebar for any webpage, allowing you to interact with LLMs while having full context of the current page.

## Features

- **Chat Sidebar**: Floating sidebar that appears on any webpage
- **Page Context Awareness**: AI has access to current page URL, title, and selected text
- **Multiple LLM Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, and OpenRouter
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture with YouTube captions plugin
- **Chat History**: Persistent conversation management across sessions
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with light/dark theme support
- **Context Chips**: Smart page metadata extraction and display
- **Quick Actions**: Analyze pages, summarize selected text, and more

## Technical Architecture

### Sidebar Injection
The extension injects a chat sidebar directly into the DOM of any webpage using a content script. The sidebar is created dynamically via JavaScript and styled with CSS to appear as a floating overlay that doesn't interfere with the page layout. This approach ensures compatibility with all websites while maintaining full functionality.

### CORS Avoidance
The extension avoids Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues by using a smart architecture:

- **Content Script**: Runs in the webpage context and handles UI interactions
- **Background Service Worker**: Acts as a proxy for API calls to LLM providers
- **Message Passing**: Chrome's extension messaging API facilitates secure communication between content script and background worker

When you send a message to an AI, the content script forwards it to the background worker, which makes the actual API call to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers. The response is then streamed back to the content script and displayed in the sidebar. This design completely bypasses CORS restrictions since the API calls originate from the extension's background context, not the webpage.

### Plugin System
The extension features a modular plugin architecture that allows for site-specific functionality:

- **Base Plugin Class**: Provides common functionality and API access
- **Dynamic Loading**: Plugins are loaded via manifest content scripts to comply with Chrome's CSP
- **Context Chips**: Plugins can display contextual information as interactive chips in the sidebar
- **Site Detection**: Plugins automatically activate based on current webpage domain

## Installation

## Plugin Development

The extension supports a modular plugin system that allows developers to create site-specific integrations. The YouTube captions plugin serves as a reference implementation.

### Creating a Plugin
1. Create a new directory under `plugins/your-plugin-name/`
2. Implement your plugin class extending `LlambPluginBase`
3. Add a `manifest.json` file with plugin metadata
4. Register your plugin in the main manifest.json

For detailed documentation on creating plugins, see [PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md](PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Available Plugins
- **YouTube Captions**: Extracts and displays video captions as context chips for YouTube videos

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Context**: OCR for images, PDF reading, webpage text extraction
2. **More Plugins**: Additional site-specific integrations (GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc.)
3. **Customization**: Sidebar positioning, keyboard shortcuts, custom themes
4. **Export/Import**: Conversation export, settings backup/restore
5. **Advanced Features**: Voice input, image analysis, code execution

## Development

### Prerequisites

### Recent Technical Improvements
The extension has been enhanced to handle Chrome's strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and context isolation:

- **CSP Compliance**: Plugin scripts are loaded via manifest content_scripts to avoid CSP eval errors
- **Context Isolation**: Proper handling of Chrome's isolated execution contexts between content scripts and webpage
- **Dynamic Loading**: Scripts are loaded dynamically with proper error handling and timing
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular system that works within Chrome's security constraints

### Debugging
